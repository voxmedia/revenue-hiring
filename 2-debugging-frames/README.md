# E2: Debugging Frames

Our Ad Agency designers have dreamed up a revolutionary new feature for our ads: a tippy apple juice animation! The animated mockup is wowing clients across all of our sites. Most of the code for the ad is written, but there are a couple bugs left to be ironed out. That is your job!

Take some time to explore the code and debug -- please spend no longer than an hour with the project. If you do not finish that is just fine! We are more interested in your approach to problem solving and debugging. Keep track of the steps you take to debug so we can have a conversation about tricky problems!

## Your Task

In the parent project, the animated mockup shows the desired animation and background color. Update the parent and frame projects so the broken ad product matches the animated mockup in the parent project.

- **Animation:** The apple juice spills when the ad nears the viewport and is cleaned up when scrolled away from the viewport.
- **Background color:** The ad should match the background color of the animated mockup. Notice the background color changes on refresh.
- **The only rule:** The parent project `iframe` should include the `sandbox` attribute.

## Getting Started

You will clone **two** projects for this exercise. The code is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). After making an account, remix the starter projects and start debugging!

Remember to update the `iframe` in the parent project to point to your new frame project!
