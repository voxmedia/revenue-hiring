# E2: Debugging Frames

Silly apple juice ad bug intro TK

If you do not finish that is just fine! We are interested in how you approach and debug. Keep track of the steps you take to dubug so we can have a conversation about tricky problems!

## Your Task

The working example shows desired animation and syle updates. Update the parent and frame projects so the broken ad in the parent project matches the example.

- The apple juice spills when any part of the ad leaves the viewport and is cleaned up when the ad enters the viewport.
- The ad should match the background color of the example, Notice the background color changes on refresh.

Do not remove the sandbox attribute on the frame in the parent project!

## Getting Started

The code is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). After making an account, you can copy starter files by remixing existing projects or cloning projects form this repo. 

Remember to update the frame `src` to point to your new project in the parent project.

### Option One
