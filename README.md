# Vox Media Programming Exercise v2

Hello and welcome, I promise this will not be painful. We are looking to understand your programming skills without sweat, live coding or intestinal distress.

We thought the best way to do this is have you **pick two** of the following ways to demonstrate your technical abilities with us:

* **Code that you previously wrote**. This should be something where you can confidently talk about the technical and architectural aspects, and the use case for this project.
* **A Javascript logging code exercise** for logging, filtering and reporting on events.
* **A Ruby string manipulation library** from our existing publishing platform.

All of these are weighted equally, we really want you to be as comfortable and confident as possible sharing your solutions with us.

The sample exercises are scoped to an hour to an hour-and-a-half because we all have lives outside of work and away from the computer too.

## Conversational Assessment

Our goal here is to learn more about the thought process behind your work. You should write this code like you are part of our team. We are interested in the decisions you made, why you made them, and how you would explain these choices and the architecture so your team can understand it. We will be asking questions like the following:

* What was the first thing you did after reading the exercises?
* Why did you chose this approach?
* Tell us more about this architecture?
* What specific syntax decisions did you make?
* Were there interesting optimizations you discovered?
* What was the most difficult part of this exercise?
* What did you do when you got stuck?
* Did you learn anything new during this project?

Additionally, pretend we work together:

* What does your teammate need to know about it?
* Did you structure it in a way that is understandable to others?
* Is it sufficiently documented?
* Given more time, what would you do next to improve the project that you didn't have time for here?

## Sharing and Submitting

During the technical call be prepared to share your screen with us in a readable (sufficiently large) font size.

# The Exercises

* A [Javascript logging](https://github.com/voxmedia/revenue-hiring/tree/master/exercise-javascript-logging) code exercise for logging, filtering and reporting on events.
* A [Ruby string manipulation library](https://github.com/voxmedia/revenue-hiring/tree/master/exericse-ruby-string-replacement) from our existing publishing platform.


# FAQ About Exercises

* **Can I use jQuery, React, Underscore, or other external libraries?** – If you feel more comfortable using familiar libraries feel free to do so, but you are not required to.

* **Who wrote this? I have so many questions** – Please send all questions to [brian.anderson@voxmedia.com](mailto://brian.anderson@voxmedia.com) and we'll try to answer them as quickly as possible.

* **Wait, you think my affiliate linking startup will be successful?** – Who knows, we are not analysts, investors nor lawyers.
