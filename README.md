# Vox Media Programming Exercise v2

Hello and welcome, I promise this will not be painful.  We are looking to understand your programming skills without sweat, live coding or intestinal-distress.

We thought the best way to do this is have you **pick two** of the following ways to demonstrate your technical abilities with us:

* **Code that you previously wrote**. This should be something that you can confidently talk about the technical, architectural and use case for this project.
* **A Javascript logging code exercise** for logging, filtering and reporting on events.
* **A Ruby string manipulation library** from our existing publishing platform.

All of these are weighted equally, we really want you to be as comfortable and confident as possible sharing your solutions with us.

The sample exercises are scoped to an hour to an hour-and-a-half because we all have lives outside of work and away from the computer too.

## Conversational Assessment

You should write this code like you were part of team. Come prepared to talk about your work.  We will be asking questions like the following:

* What was the first thing you did after reading the exercises?
* Why did you chose this approach?
* Tell us more about this architecture?
* What specific syntax decisions did you make?
* Were there interesting optimizations you discovered?
* What was the most difficult part of this exercise?
* What did you do when you got stuck?

Additionally, pretend we work together:

* What does your teammate need to know about it?
* Did you structure it in a way that is understandable to others?
* Is it sufficiently documented?
* What should we add in the next version that you didn't have time for?

## Sharing and Submitting

During the technical call be prepared to share your screen with us in a readable (sufficiently large) font size.

Optionally, you can send us your submissions via email ([brian.anderson@voxmedia.com](mailto://brian.anderson@voxmedia.com)).


# The Exercises

* A [Javascript logging](https://github.com/voxmedia/revenue-hiring/tree/exercise-javascript-logging) code exercise for logging, filtering and reporting on events.
* A [Ruby string manipulation library](https://github.com/voxmedia/moving-to-directories/tree/exericse-ruby-string-replacement) from our existing publishing platform.


# FAQ About Exercises

* **Can I use jQuery, React, Underscore, or other external libraries?** – Yes, this is totally fine. None of these examples require this, but if you feel more comfortable using these libraries go ahead.

* **Who wrote this? I have so many questions** – Please send all questions to [brian.anderson@voxmedia.com](mailto://brian.anderson@voxmedia.com) and we'll try to answer them as quickly as possible.

* **Wait, you think my affiliate linking startup will be successful?** – Who knows, we are not analysts, investors nor lawyers.
