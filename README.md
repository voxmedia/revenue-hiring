# :memo: How to prepare for your interview:

Hello, and thank you for your interest in Vox Media Engineering!

If you are joining us as part of an interview process, please work with your interview coordinator to choose the relevant technical exercises for the technical evaluation component of the interview. 
Otherwise, feel free to review any of the material here.

We typically ask candidates to spend no more than 2 hours on these exercises to prepare for a technical panel evaluation.  
For our engineering IC roles, you will typically prepare for said panel evaluation by picking:

* *Two* hiring exercises from the list given to you by your interview coordinator
OR
* *One* hiring exercise from the list given to you by your interview coordinator
* *one* demo of code that you previously worked on.

Either path you choose in your own adventure is up to you as all options are weighted equally.

The technical evaluations are meant to facilitate conversation to assess team fit, and technical and communication skills.

## Conversational Assessment

Our goal here is to learn more about the thought process behind your work. You should write this code like you are part of our team. We are interested in the decisions you made, why you made them, and how you would explain these choices and the architecture so your team can understand it. We will be asking questions like the following:

* What was the first thing you did after reading the exercises?
* Why did you choose this approach?
* Tell us more about this architecture?
* What specific syntax decisions did you make?
* Were there interesting optimizations you discovered?
* What was the most difficult part of this exercise?
* What did you do when you got stuck?
* Did you learn anything new during this project?

Additionally, pretend we work together:

* What does your teammate need to know about it?
* Did you structure it in a way that is understandable to others?
* Is it sufficiently documented?
* Given more time, what would you do next to improve the project that you didn't have time for here?

## Sharing and Submitting

During the technical call be prepared to share your screen with us in a readable (sufficiently large) font size.


# FAQ About Exercises

* **Can I use jQuery, React, Underscore, or other external libraries?** – You are free to use any tools, libraries, and frameworks you feel comfortable using.

* **Who wrote this? I have so many questions** – If you are a Vox Media job applicant and you have questions please send them all to [revenue-hiring-questions@voxmedia.com](mailto://revenue-hiring-questions@voxmedia.com).
