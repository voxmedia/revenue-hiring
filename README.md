# :memo: How to prepare for your interview

Hello, and thank you for your interest in Vox Media Engineering!

If you are joining us as part of an interview process, please work with your interview coordinator to choose the relevant technical exercises for the technical evaluation component of the interview. 
Otherwise, feel free to review any of the material here.

We typically ask candidates to spend no more than 2 hours on these exercises to prepare for a technical panel evaluation.  
For our engineering IC roles, you will (unless otherwise specified) prepare for said panel evaluation by picking:

* **Two** hiring exercises from the list given to you by your interview coordinator

OR

* **One** hiring exercise from the list given to you by your interview coordinator
* **One** demo of code that you previously worked on.

All options are weighted equally!

## The conversational assessment
The technical evaluations are meant to facilitate conversation to assess team fit, and technical and communication skills.

Here is an outline of questions or topics to expect during the panel evaluation:
* What was the use case and scope of the project? What was implemented?
* What was your process for reading through the exercise? 
* Why did you choose this approach? And what considerations were relevant in making this decision.
* What errors and challenges did you run into?
* How did you use other software programming or data skills to do this work?
* Any future work and considerations you’d like to highlight.

## Sharing and submitting
Feel free to share any slides, links or documentation to the work ahead of time by sending an email to your recruiting contact, the hiring manager or respective interviewer with your full name in the subject line.
