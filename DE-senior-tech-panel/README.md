## Overview
This readme provides an outline to the topics we may discuss in the 1-hour technical evaluation panel with the Revenue Data team. 

In this interview for the Senior ML Data Engineer position, we evaluate candidates for their clarity, depth, and fit based on their 
technical communication style. 

The interview is broken into several components, involving introductions by the team, the questions prepared, and the conclusion. 
The technical questions interviewing component will consist of 35-45 minutes of questions by the team. 
We will have time saved at the end to allow the candidates to ask the panel any lingering questions. 

The fireside chats that are scheduled before this round of technical panels encourage every candidate to reflect on their career, 
development, and industry outlook. So while there's no formal requirement for what and how to prepare, we'd like some of the 
responses to reflect the candidate's technical opinions and experiences. 
Note this means, for this round, we are solely sharing feedback on technical ability and communication. 
Following this interview is a 45 - 1 hour team fit interview, where you'll meet and get to know the team. 


## How to prepare

This topic outline table provides a glimpse into the kinds of topics we'll be asking about on the panel.

|  Topic | Outline |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Engineering  | Data validation and verification, ETL pipelines, and tooling    |
| Data Ops          | Data warehousing / Data Lakes, Cloud architecture and solutioning |
|  ML Development   | Tools, team settings, dataset considerations                      |
| Data Projects     | General software engineering skills & experience alongside the data and data sources involved |

This outline closely follows the job description.

## A note on technical evaluations
This outline is by no means everything we may discuss. 

Candidates can also expect fun bite-sized questions. I like to call them money questions because it's the best kind of pancake topping (and would our team be called money cakes without the money? :pancakes:). 
### Example

Candidate mentions Python and how they've worked with NumPy. 

We may ask, "what's the advantage of using NumPy?" 

Candidate might discuss how the library is based in C, or arrays and (maybe?) compilers.  Or none of those things, and we just move on.
