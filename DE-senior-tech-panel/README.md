## Overview
*This readme provides an outline to the topics we may discuss in the 1-hour technical evaluation panel with the Revenue Data team.*

In this interview for the Senior ML Data Engineer position, we evaluate candidates for their clarity, depth, and fit based on their technical communication style. 

### General Structure

The interview is broken into several components, involving introductions by the team, the questions prepared, and the conclusion. The technical questions interviewing component will consist of 35-45 minutes of questions outlined in the sections below. We allow the candidates to ask the panel any lingering questions at the end of the 1 hour time block. 

The fireside chats that are scheduled before this round of technical panels encourage every candidate to reflect on their career, development, and industry outlook. So while there's no formal requirement for what and how to prepare, we'd like some of the responses to reflect the candidate's technical opinions and experiences.  Note this means, for this round, we are solely sharing feedback on technical ability and communication. Following this interview is a 45 - 1 hour team fit interview, where you'll meet and get to know the team. 


## How to prepare
"How can I best prepare for the technical panel?" Congrats on making it! This question has come up a few times now.

The table below provides a glimpse into the kinds of topics we'll be asking about on the panel.

|  Topic | Outline |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Data Engineering  | Data validation and verification, ETL pipelines, and tooling    |
| Data Ops          | Data warehousing / Data Lakes, Cloud architecture and solutioning |
|  ML Development   | Tools, team settings, dataset considerations                      |
| Data Projects     | General software engineering skills & experience alongside the data and data sources involved |

This outline is by no means everything we may discuss. What's shared here closely follows the role's [job description](Sr_Data_Eng_Jd.pdf), which candidates can review. 

## A note on technical evaluations

Candidates can also expect fun bite-sized questions. I like to call them money questions because they're meant to make candidates feel rich, like on trivia game shows. 

### Here's an example

Candidate mentions Python and how they've worked with NumPy. 

We may ask, "what's the advantage of using NumPy?" 

Candidate might discuss how the library is written in C, or they may discuss arrays and (maybe?) compilers. Or none of those things, and we either prompt some hints or move on.
