# JavaScript Debugging Exercise

Our team has been asked to create a premium advertising experience for MegaBaby SuperWipesâ„¢. The ad experience they've requested allows users to perform a card sort inside the ad unit. They're hoping to get a sense of how well they are executing their refreshed company goals in the wake of the Great MegaBaby Warehouse Wipeout Incident of 2017.

The design team has created an amazing mockup for us, and our code is almost there! The CSS and HTML is bulletproof, thankfully.

But we're using the lovely [dragula](https://bevacqua.github.io/dragula/) open-source drag & drop JavaScript library â€” and we're having some problems:

## The Problems

1. The dragging doesn't work yet ðŸ˜± this feature is pretty important to this advertising experience!
1. We've written some CSS to target cards that are being dragged with the `.is-moving` class, which adds a grimacing emoji. It's supposed to be applied using JavaScript so that it appears in the "landing zone" ghost-looking card below the one attached to the user's mouse, [like in this screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vpqu6l8qhhd2d7n/megababy_dragging.png?dl=0). But it isn't working, because the same emoji _before_ the drag action persists. Help!
1. When a card is dropped in a column, the big emoji below the heading is supposed to change to be a smiley (if there are more "Yes" than "No" cards), a sad little face (if the "No" cards outnumber the "Yes" cards), or a grimacing face (if there are an equal number of "Yes" and "No" cards). [Just like this screenshot](https://www.dropbox.com/s/13a4aaq09wv5ysp/megababy_complete.png?dl=0). But we seem to be getting a JavaScript error.
1. Even when the JavaScript isn't erroring out, the emoji still isn't getting updated below the header. The advertiser _really_ wants this feature, so it would be ideal if we could ship a working version.
1. We're pretty sure after #4 is fixed, the emoji is updating! But it doesn't seem to be updating to the correct emoji, as stated as the specifications in #3. Let's try to get this last detail squared away, and the client will be so excited.

## Expected questions and discussion

- What steps did you take to debug the JavaScript problems above? There is no "wrong" answer here - everyone has their own ways of debugging code!
- What resources did you use to hunt down issues?

## Code

**[Here's a CodePen link for you to fork!](https://codepen.io/jplhomer/pen/LrELOW/)**

Here's our JavaScript code so far:

```js
dragula([
   document.querySelector('#col-start'),
   document.querySelector('#col-yes'),
   document.querySelector('#col-no')
]).on('move', function(el) {
   el.classList.add('is-moving')
}).on('moveend', function(el) {
   el.classList.remove('is-moving');

   updateEmoji();
});

function updateEmoji() {
   let numberYes = getNumberYes();
   let numberNo = getNumberNo();
   let emoji;

   if (numberNo === 0 && numberYes === 0) {
      emoji = 'ðŸ¤”';
   } else {
      if (numberYes > numberNo) {
         emoji = 'ðŸ˜„';
      }

      if (numberNo > numberYes) {
         emoji = 'ðŸ˜¢';
      }

      if (numberNo = numberYes) {
         emoji = 'ðŸ˜¬';
      }
   }

   document.querySelectorAll('.emoji').innerHTML = emoji;
}

function getNumberYes() {
   return document.querySelector('.col-yes').children().length;
}

function getNumberNo() {
   return document.querySelector('.col-no').children().length;
}
```

And the accompanying HTML, for your reference:

```html
<div class="container">
   <h1>What comes to mind when you think about MegaBaby SuperWipesâ„¢?</h1>

   <p class="emoji">ðŸ¤”</p>

   <div class="heds">
      <div></div>
      <div><h2>Yes</h2></div>
      <div><h2>No</h2></div>
   </div>
   <div class="cols">
      <div class="col-start">
         <div>Family-friendly</div>
         <div>Safe for babies</div>
         <div>Fun to use</div>
         <div>Environmentally-safe</div>
         <div>Trusted by parents</div>
         <div>I'm gonna use them</div>
      </div>
      <div class="col-yes"></div>
      <div class="col-no"></div>
   </div>
</div>
```
