We'd love you to add exercises to this repostitory of revenue hiring exercises.

## Criteria and Best Practices
Here are the criteria we've used so far to construct these exercises:

* These exercises should be given to candidates at least 3 days before the interview.
* The goal of these exercises is to:
  * Understand how the candidate **thinks about problems**
  * How **comfortable and capable they are to communicate** their process, and
  * How well they are able to **solve the problem**
* The exercises are scoped to Vox Media engineering levels denoted by the numerical-prefix of the folder.
* The exercise should be accomplishable in under an hour.
* Try to minimize surprises during the interview:
  * Try not to be too tricky with the problem
  * Accompanying the exercise should be a series of questions, to be sent alongside the exercise itself, that will be used to guide the technical interview portion.
* Try to build the exercise from a fun, fascinating and practical problem you've solved recently.
* Make sure to include the relevant context with your exercise. Including any limitations, pointers and business clues they may need.
* If the problem is sufficiently complex or has a large learning curve, decrease that by providing example code or boilerplate code to get them going.
* Don't be scared to have some fun with these exercises. A little laughter goes a long way in decreasing the anxiety.

## Antipatterns:
* Exclusively looking for best code writer.
* Offloading our work to the candidate.
* Expecting a very specific solution.

## Proposing New Exercises
1. Dream up a really interesting exercise
1. Make a branch
1. Write it up as an exercise, complete with example code and supporting documents.
1. Make a PR and seek feedback and comments from others on the team.
