# Brand Safety Exercise

Marketers today are particularly concerned about [brand safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_safety). In particular marketers want to make sure that they do not advertise on articles that contain words that they feel would leave a negative impression of their brand.

## Your Task

To help these marketers you should build an API that takes as arguments an article URL and a list of words and that returns a JSON response indicating if any of the words on the list are contained in the article.

You can use whatever technologies you want to build this API. Your API should be able hand any URL for articles published on [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/) ([here](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417586/sony-discord-playstation-consoles-investment-partnership) is an example article) and any word list that has less than 200 words.


## Questions and Discussion

- How did you start designing this API?
- What was the hardest part of your solution?
- How would this API perform if it were called every time someone viewed an article?
- How would you update your design if there were multiple lists of words that had to be checked for each article?
